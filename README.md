# molecular_junction_generator

Generate a molecular junction (electron-molecule-electrode) with FCC111 gold electrodes

This is a simple script that takes a molecular structure XYZ file as input file and 
create a GEN (and XYZ) file of the molecule sandwiched between two gold FCC111 electrodes 
of size 4x4x6.

This script needs both ASE and GPAW installed in your system.
